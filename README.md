# QuestCreationTool
Made as part of Goran de Ruiter - "Procedural Quest Creation: A Practical and Design-centric Approach" (2020)

Engine version: UE 4.24.3

Note: This project uses the Animated Texture with GIF Importer plugin by NeilFang. Using a later engine version might cause it to not work. 
The project can work without this plugin, but it means the animated GIFs in the tutorial menu will cease to function.
